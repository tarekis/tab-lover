# tab-lover

## Let your users know you LOVE them!

Did you ever want to let your users know you really, *really* *__really__* admire them with a clingy message when they leave your tab?

Yeah, me neither, but here's a package for just that!

## Installation

npm:
```
npm install tab-lover
```

Now just add the end-point of the package into your bundler or throw it into a script tag.
*(I guess i should bower this?)*
